# Aropha: Leading the Frontier of Polymer Informatics
Aropha is positioning itself as a leader in polymer informatics by driving innovation in data integration and curation for polymer research. We have expertly incorporated the [HELM repository](https://github.com/PistoiaHELM/HELMMonomerSets)—a rigorously curated database of bio-based polymers—alongside Aropha’s own extensive library of monomer units, meticulously chosen for their significance in polymer synthesis. This unified resource offers researchers and material scientists a comprehensive foundation for advanced polymer design and discovery, enhancing both the efficiency and accuracy of polymer informatics.

For a curated list of bio-based monomers, please explore the [Monomers](https://aropha.github.io/Bio-based-Monomers/) tab.
