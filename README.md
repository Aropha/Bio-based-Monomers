# HELM Monomer Sets #

This repository contains the monomer sets and file format definition that the HELM project uses. 

### Schema ###

The recommended JSON schema is stored here. Please help us keep HELM as interoperable as possible by using this format in your tools. 

### Monomer Sets ###

Currently the HELM demo tools use the monomerLib2.0 library. 

The monomer.org library is included since it contains some good ideas and is likely to form the basis for a public monomer set. However, be aware that it may be refined in the near future. 


All monomer sets are available as .json files. JSON is the recommended format. However, we recognise that a SQLlite db version and sd file may be useful, so have included them in the pack.
