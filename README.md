# Aropha: Pioneering Polymer Informatics

Aropha is aiming at becoming the forefront of polymer informatics through innovative integration and curation of polymer data. We have seamlessly integrated the [HELM repository](https://github.com/PistoiaHELM/HELMMonomerSets)—a highly curated database of bio-based polymers—with our own curated library of monomer units, specifically selected for their prevalent use in polymer development. This combined resource serves as a powerful tool for researchers and developers in material science. This database offers a comprehensive reference for monomer units used in innovative polymer design and discovery.

Please visit [Monomers](https://aropha.github.io/Bio-based-Monomers/) tab for a list of selected bio-based monomers.
