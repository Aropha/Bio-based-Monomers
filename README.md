# HELM Monomer Sets #

This repository contains the monomer sets and file format definition that the HELM project uses. 

### Schema ###

The recommended JSON schema is stored here. Please help us keep HELM as interoperable as possible by using this format in your tools. 

### Monomer Sets ###

Currently the HELM demo tools use the monomerLib2.0 library. This contains a limited number of monomers that were originally used internally by Pfizer. 

The monomer.org library was developed by Ionis and is included since it contains a better range of nucleotide monomers. 

Please be aware that work is ongoing to create a HELM approved core set which will be published in 2021. 


All monomer sets are available as .json files. JSON is the recommended format. However, we recognise that a SQLlite db version and sd file may be useful, so have included them in the pack.
