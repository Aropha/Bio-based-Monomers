# Aropha: Leading the Frontier of Polymer Informatics
Aropha is positioning itself as a leader in polymer informatics by driving innovation in data integration and curation for polymer research and science. We have expertly incorporated the [HELM repository](https://github.com/PistoiaHELM/HELMMonomerSets)—a rigorously curated database of bio-based polymers—alongside Aropha’s own extensive library of commonly used monomer units in bio-based polymer synthesis. This unified resource provides researchers and material scientists with a comprehensive foundation for in-silico polymer design, enabling the exploration and optimization of polymer structures for biodegradation properties. Aropha is empowering a new era of data-driven polymer informatics focused on accelerating sustainable material innovation and enhancing material science discovery.
