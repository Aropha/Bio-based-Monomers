The HELMCoreLibrary was developed by analyising public datasets with particular help from Evan Bolton of PubChem and Anna Gaulton and Patricia Bento of EMBL-EBI.

The HELM project recommends that all HELM users adopt HELMCoreLibrary as the core of their monomer sets even if they then add monomers to their own copy. This will increase interoperability of HELM across organisations.
